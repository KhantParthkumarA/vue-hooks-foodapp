# Vue Hooks FoodApp

A sample app to demo how hooks can work in Vue. Using [vue-hooks](https://github.com/yyx990803/vue-hooks) (still very experimental). I did a [writeup of the functionality on CSS-Tricks in this article](https://css-tricks.com/what-hooks-mean-for-vue/ ), and why they're useful in Vue.

If you'd like to see them in action, check out `src/hooks` and `src/AppGrid.vue`

Created by [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
