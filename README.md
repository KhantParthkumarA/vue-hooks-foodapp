# Vue Hooks FoodApp

A sample app to demo how hooks can work in Vue. Using [vue-hooks](https://github.com/yyx990803/vue-hooks) (still very experimental). I did a writeup of the functionality on CSS-Trick in this article, and why they're useful in Vue. 

If you'd like to see them in action, check out `src/hooks` and `src/AppGrid.vue`
